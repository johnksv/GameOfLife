/**
 * The abstract class <code>Board</code> is the superclass of
 * <code>ArrayBoard</code> and <code>DynamicBoard</code>. The main objective of
 * this class is to ensure functionality to subclasses, and compute next
 * generation of activeBoard.
 *
 * The board is represented through row-major arrays. This implies that y
 * represents rows, and x represents columns.
 * <h3>Technical information</h3><p>
 * All calculations is done on the same underlaying gameboard. This is made
 * possible by taking use of the fact that a byte consists of 8 bits (where the
 * 8th bit (MSB) is because of 2-complement).</p>
 * <p>
 * <b>The 7th-bit (64) represents alive.</b>
 * This means that living cell will have a value of 64, while dead cells has the
 * value 0.
 * <b>The first 4 least significant bits represents neighbour count.</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Counting neighbours</h4>
 * Counting of neighbours is done by incrementing the current cell for each
 * living neighbours.
 * <p>
 * E.g. Consider the following board, where x is the current cell, 1 is alive,
 * and 0 is dead:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * 010
 * 0x0
 * 010
 * </pre> x has 2 neighbours. After counting, x will have incremented its value
 * by 2. If x was alive while counting, its new value would have been 64+2 = 66.
 * If x was dead, its value would have been 0+2 = 2.
 *
 * <h4>Check rules</h4>
 * After the neighbours have been counted, we check the new value of each cell
 * with the given rule. For Conways standard rules (spawn at 3, survive at 2 and
 * 3) this means that the value of a cell must be 3, 66, or 67 to be alive next
 * generation.
 *
 * <p>
 * This method for counting neighbours and checking rules means that we don't
 * need to work with a second array, and calculations can be done in real-time
 * on the actual game board. </p>
 *
 * <h3>Performance vs Size</h3>
 * For small patterns it is recommended to use dynamic board. This is because
 * the pattern than can expand, without having to concernce that it may hit a
 * "wall". For lager patterns (such as the turing machine) it is recommended to
 * use array board. This is because dynamic board uses to much resources to
 * check and edit the board (even with concurrent next generation) compared to
 * ArrayBoard.
